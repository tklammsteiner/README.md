### microbes | environment | data

Iâ€™m a microbiologist working on microbial communities and microbe-host interactions. My main work revolves around microbiomes related to insect farming and investigating dynamics in insect mass-rearing. Besides that, I am actively contributing to research activities taking place in the [Microbial Resource Management](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/microbiology/research/microbial-resource-management/) group at the [Department of Microbiology](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/microbiology/) and the [Molecular Ecology](https://molecular-ecology.at/) group at the [Department of Ecology](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/ecology/) of the University of Innsbruck. My interests include microbiome research, data science and visualization, and making processes more efficient in a sustainable way.
